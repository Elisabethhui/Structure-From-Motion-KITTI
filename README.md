# Structure-From-Motion-KITTI
The main objective of thisproject is to understand the characteristics of a 3D reconstruction algorithm ("Structure-From-Motion") by monocular vision and to implement its main steps with Matlab. 

The code can be test by using the data download from the KITTI dataset http ://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/raw_data.php

Needed data
image 00data: the images captured by grey scale camera 00
calib cam to cam: the projection matrix after rectification of camera 00
